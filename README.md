# A SIC/XE Assembler and Linker!

The SIC/XE is a theoritical machine created by Professor Beck, from a book, "_System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming_" 

This theoritical machine is a simple 8-bit machine, with 4 different memory addressing format.

Allowing the readers to learn about the various methods utilized on lower system applications such as: an assembler and linker.

The assembler was created using a 2-pass algorithm within the book, and is created using C++; and can be ran as such:

```
SIC-XE: $ cd sic_xe
SIC-XE: $ make
SIC-XE: $ ./assembler_xe copy_xe.asm
```
